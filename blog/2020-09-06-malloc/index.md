I've just finished CPE 357, and I'm feeling quite proud about this `malloc()` implementation I wrote! Out of approximately 30 people in the class, my malloc was the second-fastest for a specific benchmark, with the average submission taking about 200us, mine taking 169us (nice), and the fastest taking 160us. I've written up some information about its implementation [here, on its project page](/projects/fast-malloc-357/), so check it out!
