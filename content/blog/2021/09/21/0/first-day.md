Today was my first day of school of this year, and the first day in-person since the pandemic began. I guess on the one hand, it feels a bit strange going to in-person classes, but on the other hand, it felt surprisingly... normal? But then I also felt a bit worried about viral transmission, too. Lots and lots mixed feelings.
