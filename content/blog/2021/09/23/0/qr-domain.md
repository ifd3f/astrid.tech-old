Someone at

today (I forgot who) brought up a very good point about my QR tattoo plan: what
if the TLD kicks you out, or disappears? What if something happens to the .tw
TLD? Also, .tw does cost quite a bit of money every year. So, I'll look into
getting a cheaper a domain name that isn't bound to a country, and renewing it
for a long time.
