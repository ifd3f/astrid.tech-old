I decided to take my radio's APRS functionality for a spin on the ride home this
Thanksgiving break.

Unfortunately, there was horrible coverage along most of the trip. It seems I
got picked up by the W6DXW-1 digipeater in King City, KI6ETL-10 in San Jose, and
WA6TOW-2 in Pacifica while I was in San Mateo, which is extremely puzzling.
Perhaps just due to sheer luck.

## What happened?

I have a Nagoya NA-771R, but its SMA connector broke, so I wasn't able to use
that. Instead, I had to rely on the rubber duck antenna, and I think I'll blame
that for my problems. I'm attempting to superglue the SMA connector, but it
doesn't seem to be holding very well - there's a few degrees of wiggle when I
install it on my handheld. I'll try soldering next, and if that doesn't work,
I'll just have to get a new one.

Another antenna I could try is my folding Abbree tactical antenna! It's very
long and it flips out dramatically, asserting dominance over people who don't
have antennas that are as long.

Additionally, when I slot it in my backpack, it fits perfectly and looks
extremely tactical, for the extra assertion of dominance. There is little reason
to _not_ use it.

![Yeah, I'm tacticool. 😎](https://s3.us-west-000.backblazeb2.com/nyaabucket/2d51f2bffe99ac8ebf68768182e7c213403f2b2664444c137697bcf72830d409/backpack-antenna.jpg)

Well, we'll see how it goes on the ride back. Perhaps I might perform some tests
around the neighborhood with the antennas beforehand, and hope I don't get the
cops called on me for being a weird lady walking around town with a strange
walkie talkie.
